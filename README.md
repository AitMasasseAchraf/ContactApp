# Contact Spring Application

The Contact Spring Application is a web-based system built using the Spring framework for Java, designed to manage and organize contact information efficiently. This application follows the principles of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and incorporates advanced features for enhanced user experience.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new contacts with detailed information, including name, phone number, email, and other relevant details.

- **Read:** View a list of all existing contacts, along with their individual details. Search and filter contacts for easy access.

- **Update:** Modify contact information as needed. Update names, phone numbers, or any other details associated with a contact.

- **Delete:** Remove unwanted contacts from the system effortlessly.

- **Grouping:** Organize contacts into groups for better categorization and efficient management. Grouped contacts can be easily accessed and managed together.

- **Name Correction with NLP:** Utilize a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm to correct names during search. This feature enhances the search experience by accommodating variations in name spelling and typos.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** Utilize the Spring Boot framework to simplify the development process and create a stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based application.

- **Thymeleaf:** Employ Thymeleaf as the template engine to seamlessly integrate server-side rendering with HTML, enhancing the dynamic aspects of the user interface.

- **Spring Data JPA:** Leverage Spring Data JPA to simplify the data access layer, making it easier to interact with the database.

- **MySQL (or your preferred database):** Store contact information in a relational database, allowing for efficient data retrieval and management.

- **NLP Algorithm:** Implement a Natural Language Processing algorithm to enhance search functionality and correct names during user input.
